1. IF YOU DID NOT USE THE DOWNSTREAM PROPERTIES DURING GENERATION
    1. Set the downstream properties in the application.properties file
2. If you need multiple downstream properties
    1. In the [Configurer](/src/main/java/config/Configurer.java) class, duplicate the bean function
    2. In the new bean function, change the function name to something you want and update the properties string.
    3. In the controller duplicate the Autowired RequestConfiguration
    4. In the duplicated RequestConfiguration set the variable name to the function name you chose in Step 2
    5. Add the new properties for the property name you chose to the properties file. You should have ( replace {propiesName} with the value you used):
        1. {propertiesName}.hostName
        2. {propertiesName}.port
        3. {propertiesName}.baseUrl
3. Add Spring boot security classes if needed
4. Modify/ re arrange functions as needed
